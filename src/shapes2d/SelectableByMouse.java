/**
 * This interface implements the <method> isPointInside </method> method.
 * This method is used to see when a point is within
 * of an area. That way, you can tell if the mouse is inside
 * of a figure, and thus be able to be selected.
 *
 * As it is an interface, you cannot add the fields of
 * <field> isSelected </field>, which would be even more correct and would work
 * to recycle the code used to select objects
 * that are printed by screen. To do this, you should create
 * an abstract class.
 *
 * Examples:
 * To know if the point (x, y) is inside the circle
 * with origin at the point (ox, oy) and radius "r" the
 * following formula:
 *
 * return (ox - x) * (ox - x) + (oy - y) * (oy - y) <(r * r)
 *
 * This formula comes from applying Pythagoras. No need to use
 * the square root since this operation consumes many resources of the
 * computer. It is better to compare the areas, it is the same in the end.
 *
 * However, to check that a point is within
 * a triangle, the algorithm is much more complicated.
